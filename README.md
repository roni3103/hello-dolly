# hello-dolly
About the Project:
My doll project from our training - nothing special just a lot of practice

Basically its much easier to use Git to work between my devices.  
I'm just getting my head around git and this is a good way to practice using it, giving the options to roll back to earlier code if I don't like the changes.

Work so far:

Removing links and replacing with simple Express routing via the routes in the main.js file -- completed for all pages.

Included Angular with ng-repeat for 'stock' items -- to set up separate controllers

Planned work:

-- To rework the purchase code entirely, based on the 'Bookshop' code in hello-world repo

-- To include a simple database for user login.

-- To connect up registration form to database

-- To include a stock database rather than JSON file
